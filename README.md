# BERTuality

is a concept for checking the actuality of text data with the language model "BERT" and for generating data conforming to actuality. This repository was part of a project seminar with the following research question: "Checking the actuality of textual data with the "BERT" language model". As a result, my team partner and I created the concept of BERTuality.
