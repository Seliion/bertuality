Our concept is called BERT-actuality (=BERTuality) and is a pipeline that is able to overcome the limitations of a pre-trained large language model by collecting correct data according to its topicality and predicting a correct value for a searched value.\n"

    "<b>Why is this important?</b> There are over 6.6 million English-language Wikipedia articles on the Internet. In the USA alone, over 5,000 new news articles are published every day. Assuming that not every source is constantly updated, it can be stated that a large amount of outdated information exists. In this context, timeliness is the property of information to be relevant to the present. Outdated information no longer corresponds to the current conditions of the real world because it has become obsolete due to decay over time. Thus, outdated information poses a danger because it is misinformation in our case. The use of misinformation can lead to misunderstanding, economic or reputational damage. Therefore, it is of great interest to both individuals and businesses to obtain and use only current information. We describe a best practice for how BERT keeps information current.\n",

    "<b>How do we achieve it?</b> BERTuality generates a current value for the [MASK] token for a sentence of the form \"Prime Minister [MASK] is the leader of Japan\". In this case, the result is the word \"Kishida\" (as of February 2023). To predict the word for the [MASK] token, the language model BERT, which was previously sensitized to the current state, is used. In the first step, BERTuality analyzes the outdated information and systematically extracts up-to-date information from various data sources. In the second step, this information is split into individual sentences and transformed into an optimal form for BERT. Procedures are presented that allow BERT to be made aware of timeliness using these sentences. In the third step, BERT is used to generate a correct and up-to-date prediction."
