    "\n",
    " <p style='text-align: justify;'>In this repository, we explore a way to check the topicality of textual data using the \"BERT\" language model and generate data corresponding to topicality. Our concept is called BERT-actuality (=BERTuality) and is a pipeline that is able to overcome the limitations of a pre-trained large language model by collecting correct data according to its topicality and predicting a correct value for a searched value.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "<b>Why is this important?</b> There are over 6.6 million English-language Wikipedia articles on the Internet. In the USA alone, over 5,000 new news articles are published every day. Assuming that not every source is constantly updated, it can be stated that a large amount of outdated information exists. In this context, timeliness is the property of information to be relevant to the present. Outdated information no longer corresponds to the current conditions of the real world because it has become obsolete due to decay over time. Thus, outdated information poses a danger because it is misinformation in our case. The use of misinformation can lead to misunderstanding, economic or reputational damage. Therefore, it is of great interest to both individuals and businesses to obtain and use only current information. We describe a best practice for how BERT keeps information current.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "<b>How do we achieve it?</b> BERTuality generates a current value for the [MASK] token for a sentence of the form \"Prime Minister [MASK] is the leader of Japan\". In this case, the result is the word \"Kishida\" (as of February 2023). To predict the word for the [MASK] token, the language model BERT, which was previously sensitized to the current state, is used. In the first step, BERTuality analyzes the outdated information and systematically extracts up-to-date information from various data sources. In the second step, this information is split into individual sentences and transformed into an optimal form for BERT. Procedures are presented that allow BERT to be made aware of timeliness using these sentences. In the third step, BERT is used to generate a correct and up-to-date prediction.</p>\n"

    "<p style='text-align: justify;'>In order to use the collected data, it is important to put it into a consistent, clean form that is useful for BERT. The reason for this is contamination of texts, which can affect subsequent predictions for the [MASK] token. In particular, the cleanup of texts is done by a function of the pipeline, which consists of a variety of regular expressions that filter out or transform various anomalies and impurities. Regular expressions are particularly suitable for textual data for data preparation, as it is possible to specify a uniform syntax of texts through these rules. All impurities, such as elements of page description languages, acronyms, abbreviations, and formatting errors that violate these rules are either replaced or transformed into a different form. This step is important because only a syntactically clean block of text can be broken down into error-free individual sentences and inserted into a list.</p>\n",

    "\n",
    "<p style='text-align: justify;'>We introduce the similarity query in the query module to reduce another portion of the input sentences to generate an improved prediction for the [MASK] token. We achieve this goal by only allowing identical or similar sentences that exceed a certain threshold as input to BERT. Similar inputs in our case are sentences that have a similarity to our [MASK] sentence. To be able to determine a similarity score, we need the vector of the [MASK] sentence and the vector of an input sentence. Using cosine similarity, a similarity value is calculated between the [MASK] sentence and the input sentence. This method is repeated for each input sentence found to determine a similarity score between -1 and 1 for each. Here -1 stands for no similarity, 0 for an independent sentence and 1 for an identical sentence. By using a predefined threshold, input records with insufficient similarity can be filtered out. This threshold is also called similarity_score (=sim_score) in BERTuality and should be a small value above 0 when using the extraction query.</p>\n"

Since there is usually only one short core information in a sentence that we need for BERTuality, it is important to extract just this core information from the sentence. Any additional information beyond this core may have a negative impact on the prediction result. Therefore, the focus query uses the previously created keywords that must be included in our sentence.

This span between the found positions forms our core information. In the next step, we truncate all words outside this interval and classify them as irrelevant for now. As mentioned earlier, our relevant information is located near the keywords, which means that some of the information may be outside the core. Therefore, after the truncation process, we again append a part of the original sentence to our core information. We refer to this appended part as the padding of the focus query. This padding can be defined by a value of our choice and includes the number of words appended to the left and right.</p>\n"

The reason for this is the priming of BERT with the input sentences created from the BERTuality pipeline described in chapter 2.2. Therefore, throughout the BERTuality pipeline, our goal is to find optimally suitable input sentences. This is because the more similar the input sentence is to the [MASK] sentence, the higher the probability that the sentence also contains the correct information to be predicted. In order to be able to generate a prediction, the corresponding input sentences from the BERTuality pipeline are passed to BERT in addition to the [MASK] sentence in the optimal input form already explained.</p>\n",

    "\n",
    "<p style='text-align: justify;'>The token problem and thus the cause of some incorrect predictions of BERTuality can be traced back to the limited vocabulary and the restriction to a single [MASK] token. This vocabulary consists of 30,000 WordPieces. WordPieces make it possible to represent a large number of complicated tokens with a relatively compact vocabulary. A token that is outside the vocabulary is formed by concatenating WordPieces. For example, \"kishida\" is tokenized by BERT to \"ki + ##shi + ##da\". To allow related WordPieces to be reassembled into a token, successive WordPieces are marked with a leading \"##\". The token problem of BERTuality refers to the fact that we are limited to one [MASK] token in our [MASK] sentence and do not know if and from how many WordPieces the searched token is formed. Consequently, the simple input prediction is limited to predicting tokens that consist of a single WordPiece.</p>\n"

    "\n",
    "<p style='text-align: justify;'>The WordPiece prediction is an extension of the input prediction. This method solves the token problem of many texts and manages to make tokens that are not included in the vocabulary predictable. Tokens, which consist of several connected WordPieces, are called WordPiece-Token (=WPT) in the following for simplification. The WordPiece prediction uses a procedure of concatenated predictions of single WordPieces with the help of a block list. The block list contains modifications of the original input sentence. The modifications of an input sentence are created by inserting the individual WordPieces of the WPT one after the other at the original token position of the WPT of the input sentence. This results in a blocklist with a length n for the number of WordPieces of a WPT. The above mentioned block lists are created for each WPT of a sentence and then passed to BERT for prediction.</p>\n"
